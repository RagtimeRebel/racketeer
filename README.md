# Racketeer

Use this template repo to quickly provision a Racket development environment in GitHub Codespaces.

Note: racket-langserver pretends to crash on startup, but Racket (.rkt) files still run properly. This is a known error, but all (5+) attempts to fix this error message have been unsuccessful (as can be seen by the commented-out lines in the .devcontainer directory), but please submit any and all recommendations!
